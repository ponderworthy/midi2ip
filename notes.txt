1.  To compile python-mido, one must edit the PKGBUILD,
and set depends() to
depends('python-rtmidi' 'python2-rtmidi')

2.  Principal code origin is under here:
https://github.com/olemb/mido/tree/master/examples

3.  python2 tcp2midi.py localhost:44440
Creates a TCP server and one JACK MIDI playback port.
Every message received by the TCP server, will be sent to
the one JACK MIDI port.

4.  python2 midi2tcp.py localhost:44440
Creates one JACK MIDI capture port.
Any MIDI messages received at that port, will be
sent to a pre-existing TCP server to which
it connects at startup.
