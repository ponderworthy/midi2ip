1.  Use the Mido library, which does MIDI and JACK and ALSA:
https://mido.readthedocs.io/en/latest/socket_ports.html

2.  The goal is a pair of applets, one MIDI to TCP,
the other TCP to MIDI, monodirectional for simplicity
and predictability.  One pair of applets per direction.
This goal has been achieved.
